# arkanoid
Small experiment using WebGL and ThreeJS

Play at your own risk! Those of you who want to try game development, even this simple game shows that unimaginable effort is necessary for creating complex games.

Now if you really want to dig into this mess, here's what you need [node js with npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

After you get this magic tool, clone arkanoid repo to your local machine and type in cmd

```
npm install
```
This will install all necesary tools

Now type

```
npm run build
```

And then 

```
npm run server
```

Head to localhost:8080 (or something like this) and you see this wonderful game
